# FBRef Web Scrapping Method

In this notebook, I collect all the relevant data for goalkeepers in the top European women's football leagues. 

Using the table ID, I targeted the data I needed and wrote a function to repeat the process for several teams and leagues. I used a mounted Google Drive to store all versions of the data frames, making it easier to recall them later in the process or for further use. Finally, I calculated per 90 values and concatenated all the data into a complete data frame. 

'Challenges & Aims'
- Organising the function to collect the data for multiple teams across multiple seasons
- Improve my object-oriented programming skills
- Clean and store data for later use
